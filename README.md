# Puzzle Slider

## About
This is a puzzle slider game, commonly referred to as a "15 Puzzle", "Mystic Square", or "Gem Puzzle".  There is a grid of scrambled tiles that need to be put in order from top-left to bottom-right by sliding around tiles into the empty tile spot.

Tiles turn green upon being moved into the correct ending location, and the completed puzzle is laid out like so:

```
1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8
9   10  11  12
13  14  15
```
